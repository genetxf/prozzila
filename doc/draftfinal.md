CHAPTER 2
PROJECT SPECIFICATION

Introduction:
A project and task management system is a software solution designed to streamline project workflows, facilitate collaboration, and enhance efficiency by organizing and tracking tasks, timelines.

General Function Description:

We leverage diagrams as a pivotal tool for comprehending the comprehensive view of the system and understanding the interrelations among its elements. In our approach, diagrams serve to simplify intricate details, allowing us to concentrate on fundamental connections. The adoption of Unified Modeling Language (UML) is paramount in facilitating a clearer understanding of the system's functionalities, aligning with its key value in simplifying and visualizing complex structures.

This perspective values UML for its capacity to provide a clear and simplified representation of the system's intricate relationships. Rather than overwhelming with details, diagrams become instrumental in focusing on the essential connections between system elements. In essence, the deployment of UML emerges as an invaluable asset in our project, aiding in the seamless comprehension and effective communication of the system's functionalities.

Requirements for a Web Development Process:

The success of our web development process hinges on several pivotal requirements aimed at delivering a robust and user-friendly final product. These requirements encompass ensuring active participation from end-users, utilizing prototyping methodologies, implementing robust change management practices, establishing immediate response mechanisms, minimizing risks, eliminating administrative overhead, and maintaining transparency and guidance throughout the development journey.

The cornerstone for success lies in a profound understanding of end-users needs. Recognizing that the customer may not be the actual end user emphasizes the significance of prototyping in our development process. Prototypes serve as initial versions of the system, subject to iterative improvements based on direct end-user involvement. This iterative approach ensures that the final product aligns seamlessly with user expectations, contributing to its success in meeting real-world needs.

Prototyping plays a central role in our Web Development Process, offering a swift and effective means to identify optimal solutions, accelerate project timelines, and ensure the end product's user-friendliness. By involving users, continuously refining prototypes based on feedback, and strategically managing risks, our approach positions the final product to thrive in the ever-changing landscape of project management.

Main Functionalities:

In 'Prozzila: A Project and Task Management System,' the core functionalities are meticulously outlined through the utilization of Use Cases, a storytelling technique crucial for uncovering and documenting requirements. These Use Cases are structured to accentuate the user's goals and perspective, providing a comprehensive overview of the system's capabilities.

A Use Case diagram, following the Unified Modeling Language (UML), acts as a behavioral representation, spotlighting the system's functionality concerning actors, their goals, and dependencies between these use cases. This visual representation offers a snapshot of the specific functionalities the system provides for each involved actor.

Within the context of Prozzila, the Use Case diagram delineates distinctive functionalities for both users and administrators. Users can partake in activities such as modifying, uploading, downloading, or deleting files within the system, contingent upon their logged-in status. Conversely, administrators possess additional rights, enabling actions such as adding, modifying, or deleting users, as well as comprehensive project management tasks including adding new projects and modifying existing ones.

The Use Case diagram presented below elucidates the specific possibilities and options available to both users and administrators within the Prozzila system. It serves as a visual guide, offering clarity on the distinct roles and functionalities each can perform within the system's framework.

CHAPTER 3: SYSTEM DESIGN AND ANALYSIS

Use Case Modeling and Description:

A use-case model serves as a comprehensive representation of how various user types interact with the system to address specific challenges. This model delineates the users' goals, their interactions with the system, and the system's anticipated behavior in fulfilling these objectives.

A use case diagram is a graphical depiction encompassing the system, related use cases, and actors. It establishes visual connections to answer fundamental questions: What is being described (System)? Who is using the system (Actors)? What goals do the actors seek to achieve (Use Cases)? By visualizing these elements, use cases play a crucial role in ensuring the development of the correct system by capturing user requirements effectively.

Actors:

Admin
User (Employee)

Every user, whether an Admin or an Employee, undergoes a username and password verification process during login attempts. In cases where discrepancies arise in the entered credentials, the system promptly displays a login error, enhancing security and user authentication.
